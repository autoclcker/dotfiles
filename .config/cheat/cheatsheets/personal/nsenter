# Figure out the PID of the container you want to enter:
PID=$(docker inspect --format {{.State.Pid}} <container_name_or_ID>)
# Then enter the container:
nsenter --target $PID --mount --uts --ipc --net --pid

# You will get a shell inside the container. Thatâ€™s it. If you want to run a specific script or program in an automated manner, add it as argument to nsenter.
# It works a bit like chroot, except that it works with containers instead of plain directories.
